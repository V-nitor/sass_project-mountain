# Exercise Finish!
## To resume my work:
### _ I had to reproduce a page web thanks a Desk & mobile sketch with HTML & SASS independently
### _ I finish the job by myself in 12 phases/parts (/commits)!
### _ To grading, I made my first branch for my very first time, named: "grading"
### _ I often updated the README.md from "main" branch to show GitHub the merit of these contributions for my "grading" branch, 5 times
### _ This last README.md is more complex to not send an empty README.md at the end of my work, unlike the other
## Thank you a lot for your time to read this last README.md for this project! See ya!
